# What is it?

squatch-sighter is a map where anybody can report a Sasquatch sighting. That's about it. So if you see a Sasquatch, be sure to report it.

# Development

It is written in Ruby, using Sinatra, and Dart. It uses the Google maps api and the Dropbox api. The site is hosted on heroku at [http://squatch-sighter.herokuapp.com/](http://squatch-sighter.herokuapp.com/)

The Javascript is compiled from Dart, and had to be included in the git repository because of Heroku. The Dart sdk that I could find was out of date, and it wasn't compiling everything correctly.

# Why?

This was an application written for a class called Computing Paradigms. Our requirement was to use Ruby and Sinatra to build some web app. I was interested in the Google maps api, and noticed that there isn't a place out there to report a Sasquatch sighting. So... I made one.

### Note

Pretty much all of the sightings on there are fake, filler data sightings. The only "real," if you can say that, sighting is the Patterson-Gimlin Film.
